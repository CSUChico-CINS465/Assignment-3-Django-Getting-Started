# Assignment-3-Django-Getting-Started
Simple assignment getting started with templates and static files.

## In this assignment your website needs to do the following:

* Display "CINS465 Hello World" via template
* Use CSS or JS to stylize page
    * I recommend using Foundations 6
* Host/Use static files embedded in your template
* Be submitted to GitHub correctly

## Submitting Assignment 3

You should upload all the project files to a folder called *Assignment_3* in that repository. You will be putting all your assignments for this class in that repository, except your final project which likely will have it's own repository.

You should make sure that your *manage.py* path in the repository is such that it can be reached via *./Assignment_3/manage.py*
